            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 jar (24 oz) marinara sauce</li>
            <li>15 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                <li>Add the marinara sauce to the cooked beef. Stir in dried basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, half of the grated Parmesan cheese, and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Place 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread one-third of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by one-third of the meat sauce, and sprinkle with one-third of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Repeat these layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
