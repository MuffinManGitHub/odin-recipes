     <p>This classic burger recipe is juicy, flavorful, and easy to make at home. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a weekend cookout!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles (optional toppings)</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayo (optional condiments)</li>
     </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, gently mix the ground beef with salt and pepper. Be careful not to overwork the meat.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties about 3/4 inch thick. Make a small indentation in the center of each patty to prevent it from puffing up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness. If using cheese, add a slice on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
            <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or skillet for about 1 minute until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom buns. Add your favorite toppings and condiments, then top with the other half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious homemade burgers!</li>
        </ol>
